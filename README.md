## ðŸ˜¸ About me:
- ðŸŽ“I'm an undergraduate student in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at UFPB (JoÃ£o Pessoa, PB / Brazil);
- ðŸ–³ Studies currently focused on Data Science, Python and Backend;
- âš¡I'm from Brazil, and I always been curious about what can I do with programming. I like to go beyond everything I do e it makes an excellent self-taught person. Whenever Im not solving math lists from college or sleeping, I code some cool stuff here and there. I have a very methodical and systematic mindset, which helps me develop projects;
- ðŸŽµ My favorite hobbie is music and I like to play guitar in my free-time, things like bossa-nova and classical guitar. Also, I love writing and poetry, and I like to write some ideas down when I have time (I'm currently trying to write a book!). Furthermore, I love sports and competitions in general, things like running, soccer, volleyball, gym, calistenics... whatever makes me move, I'm into it!
- ðŸ§  Data is my passion, and I have a goal to develop interesting things and contribuite to the AI market in someway, may inovating with some startup or becoming a resercher in the area. I see technology as much more than just a career, but also as a cause to be fought for and to make it ever more accessible, positively impacting on society's progress.
